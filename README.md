## Introduction
This exploratory data analysis was created as a capstone project for the Data Analysis and Visualization section of the Data Science course of Start2Impact, an italian startup (B Corp certified) which has been selected among the best ones in Europe in terms of education and social impact by the European Social Innovation Competition.

The analysis is already structured as a notebook which contains a formal presentation of the themes, the datasets and every information needed in order to understand what was done during the six different phases of the analysis. This section, on the other hand, will be an informal and brief explanation of why I chose this theme.
